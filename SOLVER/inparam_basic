######## INPUT FILE FOR AXISEM (SOLVER): GLOBAL WAVE PROPAGATION IN

# Choose simulation type, allowed options:
# single: Simulation of one basic source. Set sourceparams.dat for the
#         exact type
# force:  Vertical force, needs two parallel simulations (and twice the
#         number of CPUs). Set vertforce.dat for the exact source type
# moment: Full moment tensor, needs four parallel simulations. Set
#         CMTSOLUTION for the source mechanism.

SIMULATION_TYPE   moment

#### SIMULATION PARAMETERS ####
# Choose desired seismogram length and sampling rate in seconds
# Select 0.0, for SAMPLING_RATE==TIME_STEP

SEISMOGRAM_LENGTH  1800.
SAMPLING_RATE       1.0

# Receiver file type, allowed options:
# colatlon: Colatitude and Longitude for each station.
# stations: SPECFEM-style stations file with latitude, longitude
#           and station name
# database: One station at each GLL point, arbitrary station locations 
#           can be reconstructed from this.
RECFILE_TYPE      stations



# Choose desired simulation time step
# set to 0.0 for mesher's suggestion

TIME_STEP           0.1

#### MODEL / MESH ####
# Choose Mesh (local subdirname in SOLVER/MESHES directory)
# N.B. The mesh controls the velocity model and the number of CPUs

MESHNAME            AK135    

# Use lateral heterogeneities (aka 2.5D model).
# The model has to be described in inparam_hetero

LAT_HETEROGENEITY  .false.

#### WAVEFIELD SNAPSHOTS ####
# Save wavefield snapshots for visualization

SNAPSHOTS          false 

# Time interval between snapshots

SNAPSHOT_DT          20.

# Snapshot format, allowed: 
# VTK:    Paraview vtk format: Filesize may be huge
# XDMF:   NetCDF binary with XDMF descriptor. Needs NetCDF version

SNAPSHOT_FORMAT     true

# Use NetCDF for heavy output
USE_NETCDF          false
